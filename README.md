## Why did I chose this dataset?

[I chose this dataset because I have always been interested in basketball ever since I was a kid, and I am curious about the trends and factors that influence NBA draft picks. I want to explore how player performance, background, and other variables may impact their draft position and long-term success in the league.]

- [ ] Question 2: [Which colleges produced the most lottery (top-14) picks between 1989–2021?]
  - Answer: [This graph ranks the top college basketball programs based on how many of their players were selected as lottery picks in the NBA Draft between 1989 and 2021. Duke has the most, producing nearly 30 lottery picks, which far exceeds every other school. Other elite programs like Kentucky, North Carolina, and Arizona follow, but they all trail significantly behind Duke. Thus, this graph highlights Duke's prolonged dominance and success in developing top-tier NBA talent. ]

- [ ] Question 3: [Which NBA teams had draft picks whose players accumulated the most total career minutes between 1999–2020 ]
  - Answer: [This graph shows which five NBA teams drafted players who ended up playing the most total minutes from 1999 to 2020. It counts all the minutes those players logged for any team in their career, not just the one that drafted them. From the graph, we can see that the Chicago Bulls are in first place, with their draft picks playing just over 42,000 total minutes. The Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Utah Jazz trail behind them, with very similar numbers. Thus, these teams were the best at picking players who would go on to have long and useful careers in the NBA.]

- [ ] Question 4: [Which top 5 NBA teams drafted players with the most total rebounds between 1999–2020]
  - Answer: [This graph ranks NBA teams based on the total number of rebounds grabbed by all the players they drafted between 1999 and 2020. It doesn't matter if those rebounds happened with the team that drafted them or with another team, it all counts toward the total. As we can see, the Chicago Bulls are at the top, meaning their draft picks went on to grab more rebounds than any other team's picks. The top 5 NBA teams that drafted players with the most total rebounds between 1999-2020 are Chicago Bulls, Philadelphia Sixers, Atlanta Hawks, Los Angeles Clippers, and Cleveland Cavaliers as shown on the bar graph]

- [ ] Question 5: [Which top 5 NBA teams drafted players wtih the most assists between 1999–2020]
  - Answer: [This graph ranks the top five NBA teams based on the total assists accumulated by all players they drafted between 1999 and 2020, regardless of which team those assists were recorded with. As we can see the graph, The Cleveland Cavaliers(CLE) dominate the chart. The remaining teams are Atlanta Hawks (ATL), Philadelphia 76ers (PHI), Chicago Bulls (CHI), and San Antonio Spurs (SAS) are clustered closely together in a distinct second tier, indicating similar success in drafting players who became impactful, unselfish facilitators over long careers. The chart also visually emphasizes small differences between these top teams by truncating the y-axis, but the clear takeaway is that Cleveland’s drafting output in playmaking is in a class of its own, while the other four represent consistently strong but closely matched franchises in identifying talented passers.]

- [ ] Question 10: [Which NBA team drafted players with the lowest box_plus_minus?]
  - Answer: [This graph shows the five worst NBA teams at drafting valuable players between 1999 and 2020, ranked by the lowest average Box Plus/Minus. BPM measures a player’s overall impact per 100 possessions compared to a league-average player. A negative BPM means a player performs below average. These teams—New Orleans Pelicans (NOP), New Jersey Nets (NJN), Dallas Mavericks (DAL), Miami Heat (MIA), and New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets (NOK) have consistently drafted players who on average, contributed negatively on the court. This suggests long-term struggles in scouting, development, or simply bad luck in selecting players who failed to become even average NBA contributors.]
